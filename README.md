# Gage's Spacemacs Layer

This repo contains my spacemacs private layer and `.spacemacs` file.
[Spacemacs] is an emacs starter kit which mainly focuses on combining
vim and emacs.

## Installation

An installation script is coming up, but for now:

- Clone spacemacs somewhere
- `ln -s path/to/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d`
- Clone this repo somewhere
- `ln -s path/to/dotspacemacs/dotspacemacs ~/.spacemacs`
- `ln -s path/to/dotspacemacs/vandercg ~/.emacs.d/private/`

Yup, links everywhere.
